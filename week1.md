                             Task Management API - Project Plan

Project Overview 

This project aims to develop a Task Management API that allows users to efficiently manage their tasks. Users can create, update, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as complete or incomplete. The API will use Django ORM for database interactions and will be deployed on a cloud platform like Heroku or PythonAnywhere.

Features 
User Management: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. 
Task CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks. 
Task Status Management: Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete. 
Authentication & Authorization: Secure access control for users. 
Deployment: The API will be deployed on Heroku or Python anywhere.
